#  Competitive Programming Codeforces Solutions

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my solutions to problems on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). It's my personal log of learning, problem-solving, and constant improvement in competitive programming.

---

##  What's Inside

-  Solutions to **Div. 2 & Div. 3** contests
-  Practice problems from A to E (sometimes beyond!)
-  Code in **C++** (with STL, custom macros, and templates)
-  Organized by contest or problem number
- 🛠 Occasionally includes brute-force or optimized variants

---

## 📌 My Approach

Every solution here represents:
- A thought process — even if it failed at first
- Clean code (where possible 😅)
- A growing skillset in **algorithms, data structures, and speed coding**

---

## 🤓 Tech Stack

- Language: **C++**
- Editor: **VS Code**
- Compiler: `g++` with `-std=c++17` or later
- Often uses:
  - STL containers (vector, set, map, etc.)
  - Fast I/O tricks
  - Greedy, binary search, DP, graphs, and more

## 🏁 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Liki67/CP-codeforces.git
